# XSS Oblivion

## Overview
XSS Oblivion is an extreme AI-powered XSS attack suite designed for fully autonomous exploitation, AI-generated zero-day payloads, self-replicating worms, and deep network auto-pivoting. It is capable of large-scale web attacks with stealth AI-driven human emulation.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Zero-Day Discovery**: Uses AI models to generate unique XSS payloads.
- **Self-Replicating XSS Worms**: Propagates autonomously across vulnerable sites.
- **Stealth Mode**: AI human emulation to bypass detection.
- **Auto-Pivoting**: Infiltrates deeper into internal networks.
- **Global Mass Exploitation**: Attacks multiple targets simultaneously.
- **Dark Web Data Exfiltration**: Sends stolen data to hidden dark web servers.
- **Flask Web Dashboard**: Displays attack results in real-time.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xss_oblivion.git
   cd xss_oblivion
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run XSS Oblivion with:
```bash
python xss_scanner.py
```

This will:
- Perform AI-powered zero-day fuzzing.
- Deploy autonomous self-replicating XSS worms.
- Auto-pivot into internal networks.
- Exploit XSS vulnerabilities across multiple targets.
- Start the Flask web dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Configuration
Modify the `xss_scanner.py` file to adjust settings:
```python
THREADS = 500  # Max concurrent attack threads
TIMEOUT = 2  # Fast attack cycle
RATE_LIMIT = 0.02  # Aggressive scanning rate
GLOBAL_EXPLOITATION = True  # Internet-wide XSS attacks
SELF_REPLICATING_XSS = True  # AI-Powered XSS worms
AUTO_PIVOTING = True  # Deep internal network infiltration
ZERO_DAY_DISCOVERY = True  # AI-driven fuzzing for new XSS exploits
STEALTH_MODE = True  # AI emulation of human behavior
DATA_EXFILTRATION = True  # Steal credentials & sensitive data
OUTPUT_FILE = "xss_oblivion_results.json"
```

## Web Dashboard
Once the tool runs, access the attack monitoring dashboard at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
It displays logged exploits and attack results.
